# Cartoonizer

This project was created using Python libraries OpenCV and NumPy.
This project is an implementation of Bilateral Filters, Upscaling and Downscaling the image to create blur effects on the image.
Input the file destination in the filename to get the cartoonized image of the desired image
Next to preserve edges from being decomposed we apply median blur to maintain a vivid color spectrum.
Lastly, we merge two images to generate a cartoonized effect.
