# Image Editor

This project was created using Python libraries OpenCV and NumPy.
There is a library called OpenCV which provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and has optimized-machine-learning algorithms. It can be used to recognize objects, detect, and produce high-resolution images.

This project is an implementation of Bilateral Filters, Upscaling and Downscaling the image to create blur effects on the image.

Input the file destination in the filename to get the cartoonized image of the desired image.

Next to preserve edges from being decomposed we apply median blur to maintain a vivid color spectrum.

Lastly, we merge two images to generate a cartoonized effect.
